# ARTverse_Exhibition

The ARTverse project explores solutions for creating, teaching, and exhibiting art in virtual reality. In this git repository you will find a selection of tools to build a VRChat world for  an exhibition space. In our example we present the VR version of the exhibition “A Piece of Systems Ecology” from the artist Martina Froeschl.

ARTverse is a project developed by VRVis GmbH in partnership with the Science Visualization Lab, from the University of Applied Arts Vienna. The ARTverse Exhibition World was developed in collaboration with the artist and researcher Martina Froeschl.

ARTverse is funded by the netidee promotion campaign from the Internet Stiftung – Austria.
