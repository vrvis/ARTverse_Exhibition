# ARTverse_Exhibition
The ARTverse project explores solutions for creating, teaching, and exhibiting art in virtual reality. In this git repository you will find a selection of tools to build a VRChat world for creating an exhibition space. In our example we present the VR version of the exhibition “A Piece of Systems Ecology” from the artist Martina Froeschl.
